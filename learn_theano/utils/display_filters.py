    Transform an array with one flattened image per row, into an array in
    which images are reshaped and layed out like tiles on a floor.

    This function is useful for visualizing datasets whose rows are images,
    and also columns of matrices for transforming those rows
    (such as the first layer of a neural net).

    :type X: a 2-D ndarray or a tuple of 4 channels, elements of which can
    be 2-D ndarrays or None;
    :param X: a 2-D array in which every row is a flattened image.

    :type img_shape: tuple; (height, width)
    :param img_shape: the original shape of each image

    :type tile_shape: tuple; (rows, cols)
    :param tile_shape: the number of images to tile (rows, cols)

    :param scale_rows_to_unit_interval: if the values need to be scaled before
    being plotted to [0,1] or not

    :returns: array suitable for viewing as an image.
    (See:`Image.fromarray`.)
    :rtype: a 2-d array with same dtype as X.
